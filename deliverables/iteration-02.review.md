# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection
Throughout the whole process of creating the first phase of our application, there were many things we did correctly but also a couple of things that went wrong, which are good lessons for us, moving forward.

#### Decisions we made that turned out well:

1. To make our meetings as meaningful and efficient as possible, we created a document with a list of all of our questions going into the meeting. This ensured that we didn't forget to ask about something that we needed to and that we didn't waste any time in the meeting thinking about what to ask. We also created a meeting notes document and had delegated the task of taking meeting minutes to one of the team members before each meeting. This was a good decision because if one of the team members couldn't make it to a meeting, they can easily refer to this document to get a brief summary. Furthermore, if nothing was written down from the meeting, there is a high probability that we would forget about an important detail afterwards.

Here is one of our meeting notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DekoRbvQqSQ7un9vQMWB_kEwdjWPHJGxvcteECTR4Gs/edit?usp=sharing

2. Another decision that turned out well for us was organizing meetings with our partners very early on in the process. This allowed us to get all the information we needed and get all of our questions answered early to maximize the time spent working on the actual application. If we had not done so, we would be making assumptions when developing and if those assumptions turned out to be wrong, it would have been a time consuming process to redo parts of the application.

3. We used a feature in GitHub for organizing our tasks and backlog called GitHub Cards. This is a very convenient way to get a holistic picture of the current progress of our project. Because of the way we structured it, it allows us to see who is doing what tasks, their current status, what tasks are unassigned and left to be done, as well as ask for help if one of us is stuck.

Here is a screenshot of the current state of our GitHub Cards: ![GitHub Cards](GitHub-Cards.png)

4. Before doing any coding, we created a document outlining possible options that we could use for implementing different parts of our system. One such example is whether to use multithreading or not and what are the alternatives. We also summarized the workflow of the whole application to give ourselves a clear idea of the order in which things would happen in the simulation.

#### Decisions we made that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. One decision that did not go well was having fewer "work sessions" to allow people to have more time to code on their own schedule. The problem with this is that work sessions are important to allow the frontend and backend teams to integrate each other's code. Without more work sessions, the work that the team does goes to a stall, and as a result less work gets done.

2. Another decision that did not go well was we decided to start coding as quickly as possible without doing very detailed planing of the software architecture. We hoped that by starting to code earlier we would more easily be able to create a software architecture and finish the project earlier. However what happened was that without a clear plan of the software architecture, our team did not have a clear idea of what to work on.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

It is crucial to learn from your past mistakes and make any necessary changes to fix them.

1. One change that we will be making to our process is to schedule more work sessions where we all meet together, or at some people doing the frontend and some doing the backend. This is required to allow seamless integration of the backend with the frontend without having to worry about it at the very end. Leaving it all to the end could mean wasting excess time trying to integrate the two sides instead of doing meaningful work that extends the application's features.

2. Another process-related change that we are planning to make is .


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

#### How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
